# DesignPatterns
## Key points in design principles

### DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself)
#### *Eliminates reduncacy and repition.* 

1. When using built-in classes and methods( i.e. String.substring), there is no need to apply this principle further.

2. Create methods/classes when a logic is being used more than once.

3. Consider separating user interface from server side logic (for better maintenance).

4. Do not have similar code in more than one place. This minimizes bugs and makes testing easier.

5. Write short methods. 
6. Keep it simple. Each method should only solve one problem.
